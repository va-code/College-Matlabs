The problems solved are taken from:
"Elementary Differential Equations and boundary Value Problems 11th edition, BOYCE, DIPRIMA, MEADE"

The actual code was created first by understanding the series of opperations given by the 
textbook for the approximation method. Next matlab/octave scripts were developed to solve 
any problems given in the textbook.

The following methods implemented
Euler method
Improved Euler
Runge-Kutta

These are the most used methods for approximating complex systems.

This was developed in Octave so there may be bugs if run on matlab.
